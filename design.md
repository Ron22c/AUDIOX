Great! Let's design a microservices architecture for your PDF-to-audio story application with a focus on emotional TTS, modularity, and scalability — using open-source and free tools wherever possible.

🧩 HIGH-LEVEL MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
We'll break down the system into 8 core services, each handling a single responsibility. All microservices can communicate via REST/gRPC or via a lightweight event bus like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

📦 MICROSERVICE FLOW EXPLAINED
1. PDF Upload Service
Exposes an API to upload PDF files

Saves metadata in DB (e.g., uploaded_by, title, etc.)

Saves the file in MinIO or S3-compatible storage

2. Text Extraction Service
Reads the uploaded PDF

Cleans the text (removes headers, breaks into paragraphs)

Passes to the next service via REST or async messaging

3. Text Structuring & Emotion Tagging
Runs NLP to identify:

Dialogues

Narrator voice

Emotions per sentence/paragraph

Tags each segment with emotion class (e.g., joy, anger)

Stores result as JSON

4. TTS Generation Service
Converts tagged text to speech

Supports multiple voices and emotions

Uses Coqui TTS or ESPnet for emotional speech

Outputs high-quality .mp3 files

5. Audio Storage Service
Receives audio files from TTS generator

Uploads to MinIO (or S3-compatible)

Stores metadata: duration, speaker, emotion, chapter

6. Content Delivery API
Serves list of stories, audio chapters

Allows audio streaming or download

User progress tracking

7. User Auth Service
Handles user registration/login

Issues JWT tokens

Can be extended to manage subscriptions

8. Frontend App (Mobile/Web)
React Native app with:

Audio player

Story library

Offline mode

User bookmarks, playback speed

🌐 INTERSERVICE COMMUNICATION
Use message queues for long tasks (e.g., TTS processing):

RabbitMQ or Kafka (free)

Alternatively: use Celery + Redis for job queue

Use REST/gRPC for:

Upload, extraction, playback

Real-time interactions

🛠️ OPEN SOURCE TOOL SUMMARY
Function	Tool

Auth	Keycloak, OAuth2, Firebase Auth (free tier)
API Backend	FastAPI, Node.js + Express
Mobile App	React Native + Expo
Monitoring	Prometheus, Grafana (optional)
CI/CD	GitHub Actions, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (optional)

🚀 Deployment Suggestion
Start locally with Docker Compose

Use Render, Railway, or Fly.io (free hosting tiers)

Move to Kubernetes (e.g., K3s or GKE Autopilot) when scaling
